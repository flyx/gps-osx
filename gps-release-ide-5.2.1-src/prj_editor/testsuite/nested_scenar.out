--  Tests whether a scenario tested in a package is correctly put in the
--  project declaration itself. This is mandatory, so that this scenario
--  variable can be used in the nested cases for the project and any of
--  the packages.
--  This is done lazily, only when the project is modified. You thus need
--  to add an attribute "Source_Files" to the "Compiler" package below
