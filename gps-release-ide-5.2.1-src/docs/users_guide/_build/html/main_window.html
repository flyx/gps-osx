<span id="index-0"></span><span id="id1"></span><h2>2.1. The Welcome Dialog<a class="headerlink" href="#the-welcome-dialog" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<span class="target" id="index-1"></span><img alt="_images/welcome.jpg" id="index-2" src="_images/welcome.jpg" />
<p>When starting GPS, a welcome dialog is displayed by default, giving the
following choices:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><em>Create new project from template</em></dt>
<dd>If you select this option and then click the <cite>OK</cite> button, GPS will
launch an assistant to create a project using one of the predefined project
templates.</dd>
<dt><em>Start with default project in directory</em></dt>
<dd><p class="first" id="index-3">If you select this option and click on the <cite>OK</cite> button, GPS will
first look for a project called <tt class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">default.gpr</span></tt> in the current directory
and load it if found. Otherwise, it will copy in
the current directory the default project found under
<tt class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;prefix&gt;/share/gps/default.gpr</span></tt> and load it.
GPS will remove this copy when exiting or loading another project, if the
copy has not been modified during the session.</p>
<p class="last">If the current directory is not writable, GPS will instead load directly
<cite>&lt;prefix&gt;/share/gps/readonly.gpr</cite>. In this case, GPS will work in a
degraded mode, where some capabilities will not work (such as building and
source navigation).</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>Create new project with wizard</em></dt>
<dd><p class="first" id="index-4">Selecting this option and clicking on the <cite>OK</cite> button will start a
wizard allowing you to specify most of the properties for a new project. Once
the project is created, GPS will save it and load it automatically.
See <a class="reference internal" href="projects.html#the-project-wizard"><em>The Project Wizard</em></a> for more details on the project wizard.</p>
<p>Several kinds of wizard are available. Depending on the kind of project,
you will get asked different type of information. In the end, GPS will create
one or more project files, and automatically load them.</p>
<p class="last">One of the wizard, &#8220;From existing Ada sources&#8221;, will try and import a set of
sources and object files, and attempt to create one or more project files so
that building your application through these project files will put the
objects in the same directory they are currently in. If you have not compiled
your application when launching this wizard, GPS will create a single project
file and all object files will be put in the same object directory. This is
the prefered method when importing sources with duplicate file names, since
the latter is only authorized in a single project file, not across various
project files.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>Open existing project</em></dt>
<dd><p class="first last" id="index-5">You can select an existing project by clicking on the <cite>Browse</cite> button,
or by using a previously loaded project listed in the combo box. When a
project is selected, clicking on the <cite>OK</cite> button will load this
project and open the main window.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>Always show this dialog when GPS starts</em></dt>
<dd><p class="first">If unset, the welcome dialog won&#8217;t be shown in future sessions.
In this case, GPS will behave as follows: it will first look for a
<cite>-P</cite> switch on the command line, and load the corresponding project if
present.
Then, it will look for a project file in the current directory and will
load the first project file found.</p>
<p>If no project file can be found in the current directory, GPS will start
with the default project.</p>
<p>To reset this property, go to the menu <cite>Edit-&gt;Preferences</cite>.
.. index:: preferences</p>
<p class="last"><a class="reference internal" href="extending.html#the-preferences-dialog"><em>The Preferences Dialog</em></a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>Quit</em></dt>
<dd>If you click on this button, GPS will terminate immediately.</dd>
</dl>
<p id="index-6">When you specify a -P switch on the command line, or if there is only one
project file in the current directory, GPS will start immediately with
the project file specified, instead of displaying the welcome dialog.</p>
<p>In addition, if you specify source files on the command line, GPS will also
start immediately, using the default project if no project is specified.</p>
<p>By default, files specified on the command line are taken as is and can
be absolute or relative pathnames. In addition, if you prepend a filename
with the <cite>=</cite> character, then GPS will look for the file in the source
search path of the project.</p>

<p id="index-10">This is a standard menu bar that gives access to all the global
functionalities of GPS. It is usually easier to access a given functionality
using the various contextual menus provided throughout GPS: these menus
give direct access to the most relevant actions given the current context
(e.g. a project, a directory, a file, an entity, ...). Contextual menus
pop up when the right mouse button is clicked or when using the special
<tt class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">open</span> <span class="pre">contextual</span> <span class="pre">menu</span></tt> key on most PC keyboards.</p>

<span class="target" id="index-17"></span><span class="target" id="index-18"></span><p id="index-19">The project view provides a representation of the various components of your
project hierarchy, as listed below.
It is displayed by default on the left side of the main window, and can
be selected by using the <cite>Project-&gt;Project View</cite> or
<cite>Tools-&gt;Views-&gt;Project</cite> menu items.</p>
<p id="index-20">Under Windows, it is possible to drop files (coming e.g. from the Explorer)
in the project view with the following behavior: a project file dropped
will be loaded; any other file will be opened in a new source editor.</p>
<img alt="_images/project-view.jpg" id="index-21" src="_images/project-view.jpg" />
<p id="index-22">The project view, as well as the file and outline view provide an
interactive search capability allowing you to quickly
search in the information currently displayed. The default key
to start an interactive search is <tt class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">control-f</span></tt>.</p>
<p id="interactive-search">This will open a small window
at the bottom of the view where you can interactively type names.
The first matching name in the tree will be selected while you type it.
You can then also use the <tt class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">up</span></tt> and <tt class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">down</span></tt> keys to navigate through
all the items matching the current text.</p>
<p>The various components that are displayed are:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><em>projects</em></dt>
<dd><p class="first" id="index-23">All the sources you are working with are put under
control of projects. These projects are a way to store the switches to
use for the various tools, as well as a number of other properties.</p>
<p>They can be organized into a project hierarchy, where a root project
can import other projects, with their own set of sources.</p>
<p>Initially, a default project is created, that includes all the sources
in the current directory.</p>
<p>The <cite>Project View</cite> displays this project hierarchy: the top node
is the root project of your application (generally, this is where the
source file that contains the main subprogram will be located). Then a node
is displayed for each imported project, and recursively for their own imported
projects.</p>
<p>A given project might appear multiple times in the
<cite>Project View</cite>, if it is imported by several other projects.</p>
<p>There exists a second display for this project view, which lists all projects
with no hierarchy: all projects appear only once in the view, at the top
level. This display might be useful for deep project hierarchies, to make it
easier to find projects in the project view.</p>
<p id="index-24">This display is activated through the contextual menu entry
<cite>Show flat view</cite>, which acts as a switch between the two displays.</p>
<p class="last">A special icon with a pen mark is displayed if the project
was modified, but not saved yet. You can choose to save it at any time
by right-clicking on it. GPS will remind you to save it before any
compilation, or save it automatically, if the corresponding preference
is saved.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><em>directories</em></p>
<blockquote>
<div><span class="target" id="index-25"></span><p id="index-26">The files inside a project can be organized into several physical
directories on the disk. These directories are displayed under each
project node in the <cite>Project View</cite></p>
<p id="index-27">You can chose whether you want to see the absolute path names for the
directories or paths relative to the location of the project. This is done
through the <cite>Show absolute paths</cite> contextual menu.</p>
<p>Special nodes are created for object and executables directories. No
files are shown for these.</p>
<p id="index-28">The contextual menu entry <cite>Show hidden directories</cite> can be used to filter
the directories considered as hidden. This can be used to not display the
version control directories like <tt class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">CVS</span></tt> or <tt class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">.svn</span></tt> for example.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><em>files</em></p>
<blockquote>
<div><span class="target" id="index-29"></span><p id="index-30">The source files themselves are stored in the directories, and
displayed under the corresponding nodes. Note that
only the source files that actually belong to the
project (i.e. are written in a language supported by that project and
follow its naming scheme) are actually visible.
For more information on supported languages, <a class="reference internal" href="projects.html#supported-languages"><em>Supported Languages</em></a>.</p>
<p>A given file might appear multiple times in the <cite>Project View</cite>,
if the project it belongs to is imported by several other projects.</p>
<p>If you left click on a file and keep the button pressed, you can drop it
anywhere in GPS to open an editor at that location.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><em>entities</em></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p id="index-31">If you open the node for a source file, the file is parsed by one of the
fast parsers integrated in GPS so that all entities declared in
the project can be shown. These entities are grouped into various
categories, which depend on the language. Typical categories include
subprograms, packages, types, variables, tasks, ...</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Double-clicking on a file, or simple clicking on any entity will open
a source editor and display respectively the first line in this file
or the line on which the entity is defined.</p>
<p>You can also drag a file anywhere into GPS. This will open a new editor
if the file is not already edited, or move the existing editor otherwise.
If you press <tt class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">shift</span></tt> at the same time, and the file is already edited,
a new view of the existing editor is created instead.</p>
<span class="target" id="index-32"></span><p id="index-33">If you open the search dialog through the <cite>Navigate-&gt;Find or Replace...</cite>
menu, you have the possibility to search for anything in the project view,
either a file or an entity. Note that searching for an entity can be slow
if you have lots of files, and/or big files.</p>
<span class="target" id="index-34"></span><p id="index-35">A contextual menu, named <cite>Locate in Project View</cite>, is also provided when
inside a source editor. This will automatically search for the first entry for
this file in the project view. This contextual menu is also available in other
modules, e.g. when selecting a file in the <cite>Dependency Browser</cite>.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-configuration-variables">
<h3>2.6.1. The configuration variables<a class="headerlink" href="#the-configuration-variables" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<span class="target" id="index-36"></span><span class="target" id="index-37"></span><span class="target" id="index-38"></span><span class="target" id="index-39"></span><span class="target" id="index-40"></span><p id="index-41">As described in the GNAT User&#8217;s Guide, the project files can be
configured through external variables (typically environment
variables). This means that e.g. the exact list of source files, or the
exact switches to use to compile the application can be changed when
the value of these external variables is changed.</p>
<p>GPS provides a simple access to these variables, through a window
called the <cite>Scenario View</cite>. These variables are called
<cite>Configuration Variables</cite>, since they provide various scenarios for
the same set of project files.</p>
<img alt="_images/scenario-view.jpg" id="index-42" src="_images/scenario-view.jpg" />
<p>A combo box is displayed in this area for each environment
variable the project depends on. The current value of the variable can
be set simply by selecting it from the pop-down window that appears
when you click on the arrow on the right of the variable name</p>
<p id="index-43">New variables can be added through the contextual menu
<cite>Project-&gt;Add Configuration Variable</cite> in the <cite>Project View</cite>.
The list of possible values for a variable can be changed by clicking on the
button on the left of the variable&#8217;s name.</p>
<p>Whenever you change the value of one of the variables, the project is
automatically recomputed, and the list of source files or directories
is changed dynamically to reflect the new status of the
project. Starting a new compilation at that point will use the new
switches, and all the aspects of GPS are immediately affected
according to the new setup.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="icons-for-source-language-entities">
<h3>2.6.2. Icons for source language entities<a class="headerlink" href="#icons-for-source-language-entities" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p id="index-44">Entities in the source code are presented with representative icons within the
various GPS views (the <em>Outline</em>, <em>Project</em>, and <em>Entity</em> views, for example).
These icons indicate both the language categories of the entities, such as
packages and methods, as well as compile-time visibility.  In addition, the
icons distinguish entity declarations from other entities.  The same icons are
used for all programming languages supported by the viewers, with
language-specific interpretations for both compile-time visibility and
recognizing declarations.</p>
<p>There are five language categories used for all supported languages: <em>package</em>,
<em>subprogram</em>, <em>type</em>, <em>variable</em>, and <em>generic</em>.  The icons corresponding to
these language categories are as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">The <em>package</em> category&#8217;s icon is a square.</p>
<img alt="_images/square_x.png" src="_images/square_x.png" />
</li>
<li><p class="first">The <em>subprogram</em> category&#8217;s icon is a circle.</p>
<img alt="_images/circle_x.png" src="_images/circle_x.png" />
</li>
<li><p class="first">The <em>type</em> category&#8217;s icon is a triangle.</p>
<img alt="_images/triangle_x.png" src="_images/triangle_x.png" />
</li>
<li><p class="first">The <em>variable</em> category&#8217;s icon is a dot.</p>
<img alt="_images/dot_x.png" src="_images/dot_x.png" />
</li>
<li><p class="first">The <em>generic</em> category&#8217;s  icon is a diamond.</p>
<img alt="_images/diamond_x.png" src="_images/diamond_x.png" />
</li>
</ul>
<p>These basic icons are enhanced with decorators, when appropriate, to indicate
compile-time visibility constraints and to distinguish declarations from
completions. For example, the icons for entity declarations have a small &#8216;S&#8217;
decorator added, denoting a &#8216;spec&#8217;.</p>
<p>With respect to compile-time visibility, icons for &#8216;protected&#8217; and &#8216;private&#8217;
entities appear within an enclosing box indicating a visibility constraint. For
entities with &#8216;protected&#8217; visibility, this enclosing box is colored in gray.
&#8216;Private&#8217; entities are enclosed within a red box.  The icons for &#8216;public&#8217;
entities have no such enclosing box. For example, a variable with &#8216;private&#8217;
visibility would be represented by an icon consisting of a dot enclosed within
a red box.</p>
<p>These additional decorators are combined when appropriate. For example, the
icon corresponding to the &#8216;private&#8217; declaration of a &#8216;package&#8217; entity would be
a square, as for any package entity, with a small &#8216;S&#8217; added, all enclosed
within a red box.</p>
<p>Language constructs are mapped to the categories in a language-specific manner.
For example, C++ namespaces and Ada packages correspond to the <em>package</em>
category.  C functions and Ada subprograms correspond to the <em>method</em> category,
and so on.  The <em>generic</em> category is a general category representing other
language entities, but note that not all possible language constructs are
mapped to categories and icons.  (Note also that the <em>generic</em> category does
not correspond to Ada generic units or C++ templates.)</p>
<p>The names of the categories should not be interpreted literally in terms of
language constructs because the categories are rather general, in order to
limit the number used. The <em>variable</em> category includes both constants and
variables in Ada, for example. Limiting the number of categories maintains a
balance between presentation complexity and the need to support distinct
programming languages.</p>
<p>Icons for a given entity may appear more than once within a view. For example,
an Ada private type will have both a partial view in the visible part of the
enclosing package as well as a full view in the private part of the package.
Two triangle icons will therefore appear for the two occurrences of the type
name, one with the additional decorator indicating the &#8216;private&#8217; compile-time
visibility.</p>

<p id="index-47">GPS provides an <cite>Entity View</cite> which allows you to browse and quickly find all
Ada entities referenced in the currently loaded project hierarchy. This view
can be accessed through the <cite>Tools-&gt;Views-&gt;Entities</cite> menu.</p>
<img alt="_images/entity-view.jpg" id="index-48" src="_images/entity-view.jpg" />
<p>This view is divided in three parts: a <cite>Pattern</cite> entry, a tree view, and a
documentation view.</p>
<p>To query an entity, enter a search pattern in the <cite>Pattern</cite> entry. The tree
view then shows a list of all known entities which start with this pattern.
When an entry is selected in the tree, the documentation view displays the
documentation corresponding to the selected entity.</p>
<p>When the <cite>File View</cite> has the focus, using the up/down arrow keys changes the
selection in the tree, and pressing the Enter key opens an editor to the
declaration of the selected entity. It is also possible to jump to this
location by double-clicking on the line in the tree, or by clicking on the
hyperlink in the documentation view.</p>

the <cite>Tools-&gt;Views-&gt;Windows</cite> menu.</p>
<p>It can display the opened windows in one of two ways:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Sorted alphabetically</li>
<li>Organized by notebooks, as in the GPS window itself. This latter view
is mostly useful if you have lots of windows open</li>

<p>The mode is selected through the contextual menu.</p>
<p>You can also choose, through this contextual menu, whether only the source

<p>This window allows you to quickly select and focus on a particular window, by
clicking on the corresponding line with the left mouse button. If you click and
leave the mouse button pressed, this starts a drag and drop operation so that
you can also move the window to some other place in the desktop (see the
description of the MDI earlier in this document).</p>
<p>Multiple windows can be selected by clicking with the mouse while pressing the

<div class="section" id="the-clipboard-view">
<span id="id10"></span><h2>2.11. The Clipboard View<a class="headerlink" href="#the-clipboard-view" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p id="index-52">GPS has an advanced mechanism for handling copy/paste operations.</p>
<p>When you select the menus <cite>Edit-&gt;Copy</cite> or <cite>Edit-&gt;Cut</cite>, GPS adds the current
selection to the clipboard. As opposed to what lots of applications do, it
doesn&#8217;t discard the previous contents of the clipboard, but save it for future
usage. It saves a number of entries this way, up to 10 by default.  This value
is configurable through the <cite>Clipboard Size</cite> preference.</p>
<p>When you select the menu <cite>Edit-&gt;Paste</cite>, GPS will paste the last entry made in
the clipboard at the current location in the editor.</p>
<p>If you immediately select <cite>Edit-&gt;Paste Previous</cite>, this newly inserted text will
be removed, and GPS will instead insert the second to last entry added to the
clipboard. You can keep selecting the same menu to get access to older entries.</p>
<p>This is a very powerful mechanism, since it means you can copy several distinct
lines from a place in an editor, move to an other editor and paste all these
separate lines, without having to go back and forth between the two editors.</p>
<p>The <cite>Clipboard View</cite> provides a graphical mean of seeing what is currently
stored in the clipboard. It appears as a list of lines, each of which is
associated with one level of the clipboard. The text that shows in these lines
is the first line of the selection at that level that contains non blank
characters. Leading characters are discarded. <cite>[...]</cite> is prepended or appended
in case the selection has been truncated.</p>
<p>If you bring the mouse over a line in the <cite>Clipboard View</cite>, a tooltip will pop
up showing the entire selection corresponding to the line by opposition to the
possibly truncated one.</p>
<p>In addition, one of the lines has an arrow on its left. This indicates the line
that will be pasted when you select the menu <cite>Edit-&gt;Paste</cite>. If you select
instead the menu <cite>Edit-&gt;Paste Previous</cite>, then the line below that one will be
inserted instead.</p>
<p>If you double-click on any of these lines, GPS will insert the corresponding
text in the current editor, and make the line you clicked on the current line,
so that selecting <cite>Edit-&gt;Paste</cite> or the equivalent shortcut will now insert that
line.</p>
<p>The contextual menu in the clipboard view provides one entry, which is <cite>Append
To Previous</cite>. If you select this entry, the select line will be append to the
one below, and removed from the clipboard. This means that selection
<cite>Edit-&gt;Paste</cite> will in fact paste the two entries at the same time. This is in
particular useful when you want to copy lines from separate places in the
initial file, merge them, and then paste them together one or more times later
on, through a single operation.</p>
<p>The Clipboard View content is preserved between GPS sessions. As an exception,
huge entries are removed and replaced with an entry saying &#8220;[Big entry has been
removed]&#8221;.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-callgraph-view">
<span id="id11"></span><h2>2.12. The Callgraph View<a class="headerlink" href="#the-callgraph-view" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p id="index-53">The callgraph view plays a role similar the callgraph browser. They display the
same information about entities, but in two different ways: the callgraph view
displays the information in a tree, easily navigable and perhaps easier to
manipulate when lots of entities are involved; the callgraph browser displays
the information as graphical boxes that can be manipulated on the screen, and
is best suited to generate a diagram that can be later exported to your own
documents.</p>
<p>This callgraph view is used to display the information about what subprograms
are called by a given entity, and, opposite, what entities are calling a given
entity.</p>
<p>Some references might be reported with an additional &#8221; (dispatching)&#8221; text.  In
such a case, this indicates that the call to the entity is not explicit in the
sources, but could occur through dynamic dispatching. This of course depends on
what arguments are passed to the caller at run time, and it is possible that
the subprogram is in fact never dispatched to.</p>
<p>This view is automatically displayed when you select one of the contextual
menus <cite>... calls</cite> and <cite>... is called by</cite>. Every time you select one of these
menus, a new view is opened to display that entity.</p>
<p>Whenever you expand a node from the tree by clicking on the small expander
arrow on the left of the line, further callgraph information is computed for
the selected entity, which makes it very easy to get information for a full
callgraph tree.</p>
<p>Closing and expanding a node again will recompute the callgraph for the entity.</p>
<p>On the right side of the main tree, a list displays the locations of calls for
the selected entity. Clicking on entries in this list opens editors showing the
corresponding location.</p>
<p>The Callgraph View supports keyboard navigation: <cite>Up</cite> and <cite>Down</cite> keys navigate
between listed locations, <cite>Left</cite> collapses the current level, <cite>Right</cite> expands
the current level, and <cite>Return</cite> jumps to the currently selected location.</p>
<p>The callgraph view is automatically saved in the desktop, and restored the next
time you restart GPS. However, the information displayed in these might no
longer be accurate at this stage, since it shows the status of the callgraph
during the last GPS session.</p>
<p>Left-clicking on a line in the Call Tree brings up a contextual menu with the
following entries:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><em>Collapse all</em></dt>
<dd>Collapse all the entities in the Callgraph View.</dd>

<p id="index-54">Bookmarks are a convenient way to remember places in your code or in your
environment so that you can go back to them at any point in the future.  These
bookmarks are saved automatically whenever they are modified, and restored when
GPS is reloaded, so that they exist across GPS sessions.</p>
<p>Bookmarks will automatically remember the exact location in an editor, not in
terms of line/column, but in terms of which word they point to. If you modify
the file through GPS, the bookmark will be automatically updated to keep
refering to the same place. Likewise if you close and reopen the file.
However, when the file is modified outside of GPS, the bookmark will not be
aware of that change, and will thus reference another place in the file.</p>
<p>The menu <cite>Edit-&gt;Create Bookmark</cite> allows you to create a bookmark at the current
location (either in the editor, or the browser for instance).</p>
<p>All the bookmarks you have created will be visible in the
<cite>Tools-&gt;Views-&gt;Bookmarks</cite> window. Clicking on the small icon to the left side
of each line will immediately jump to that bookmark.</p>
<p>You can rename a bookmark so that it is easier to remember what it refers to.
To do so, open the Bookmarks window, and click twice on the line of the
bookmark. This will change the way the name is displayed, so that you can edit
it in place. Press <tt class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">enter</span></tt> when you are done modifying the name.</p>
