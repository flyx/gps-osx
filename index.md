## GPS-OSX

**GPS-OSX** is a modified version the [GNAT Programming Studio][1] for OSX.
Compared to the version provided by [AdaCore][2] with GNAT GPL 2013, it
provides the following enhancements:

 * It is built against gtk-quartz and thus does not need an X11 server to run.
 * You can use the command key `âŒ˜` as modifier for keyboard shortcuts. Because
   of this, its configuration files will be incompatible with AdaCore's gps and
   will therefore be placed in `~/.gps-osx` instead of `~/.gps` so that the two
   versions do not interfere with each other.
 * It comes as an app bundle which can simply be dropped into your
   `/Applications` folder.

**Important**: gtk-quartz is considered experimental and you should not expect
this binary to be stable. It also is in no way supported by [AdaCore][2]. Be
aware of this before you decide to use it for any serious software development.

### Download

I host a readily compiled app bundle on my server:

[Download!][4]

This is built on the base of commit
[1ed91852a52af3c27ed99bc868280ea2e996a572][3].

Please note that I do not plan to create *stable* releases. I just spread the
latest binary I use myself here.
