<a name="gps-osx" class="anchor" href="#gps-osx"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>GPS-OSX</h3>

<p><strong>GPS-OSX</strong> is a modified version the <a href="http://libre.adacore.com/tools/gps/">GNAT Programming Studio</a> for OSX. Compared to the
version provided by <a href="http://www.adacore.com/">AdaCore</a> with GNAT GPL 2013, it provides the following enhancements:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is built against gtk-quartz and thus does not need an X11 server to run.</li>
<li>You can use the command key <code>âŒ˜</code> as modifier for keyboard shortcuts. Because of this, its
configuration will be incompatible with AdaCore's gps and will therefore be placed in
<code>~/.gps-osx</code> instead of <code>~/.gps</code> so that the two versions don't interfere with each other.</li>
<li>It comes as an app bundle which can simply be dropped into your <code>/Applications</code> folder.</li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="very-important---please-read-before-downloading" class="anchor" href="#very-important---please-read-before-downloading"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Very important - please read before downloading</h3>

<ul>
<li>gtk-quartz is considered experimental and you should not expect this binary to be stable.
It also is in no way supported by <a href="http://www.adacore.com/">AdaCore</a>. Be aware of this before you decide to use
it for any serious software development.</li>
<li>In order to take advantage of the command key, you need to change the default keyboard
shortcuts - those have not been migrated to use command instead of control automatically.</li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="download" class="anchor" href="#download"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Download</h3>

<p>I host a readily compiled app bundle on my server:</p>

<p><a href="http://flyx.org/files/GPS-1606baf.dmg">Download!</a></p>

<p>This is built on the base of commit <a href="https://github.com/flyx86/gps-osx/commit/1606baff7a095e3a0a7c5978bca414b8d8265e09">1606baff7a095e3a0a7c5978bca414b8d8265e09</a>.</p>

<p>Please note that I do not plan to create <em>stable</em> releases. I just spread the latest binary
I use myself here.</p>

<h3>
<a name="known-issues" class="anchor" href="#known-issues"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Known issues</h3>

<ul>
<li>Fonts are quite small in the editor and project view. But you can change these in GPS' preferences.</li>
<li>The autocomplete list is not rendered below the cursor, but quite some pixels off.</li>
<li>Setting the <code>GPR_PROJECT_PATH</code> does not work when double-clicking the app bundle. If you need it,
you have to launch <code>GPS.app/Contents/MacOS/GPS</code> from the terminal. I have no idea why this is
happening - the environment variable can be set in the Info.plist in the app bundle so that GPS is
loaded with it, and it will be set in GPS then, but GPS won't load projects from there anyway.
Maybe it's a sandboxing issue or something.</li>
<li>GPS does not use the standard OSX menu bar. To be able to do this, one would need to patch
GtkAda to provide the necessary binding to GtkOSXApplication and then patch GPS to use it. This
doesn't seem worth the effort.</li>
<li>This list is not complete and will probably be grow as I use my native GPS.</li>
